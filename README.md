# portfolio

This is the foundation that my current portfolio is based off of. I did this because I not only needed a new look & feel on my portfolio site, but also because I thought that someone else could find this handy, and I wanted to practice my HTML, CSS, & JS skills. This is based off of the UIKit 3, beta 9 framework.
