Updated portfolio using UIKit.

As I'm trying to learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to rewrite my portfolio using UIKit. UIKit has more functionality than Bootstrap, however I feel that the learning curve is slightly steeper. This isn't a bad thing, as it forces me to try something new. As I go through and continue to update my portfolio, I'll be uploading more and more portfolio pieces.
